### Common Troubleshooting for NGINX OIDC and All IdPs

Any errors generated by the OpenID Connect flow are logged to the error log, `/var/log/nginx/error.log`. Check the contents of this file as it may include error responses received by the IdP. The level of detail recorded can be modified by adjusting the severity level of the `error_log` directive.

- 400 error from IdP
- 500 error from nginx after successful authentication
- Authentication is successful but browser shows too many redirects
- Logged out but next request does not require authentication
- Failed SSL/TLS handshake to IdP
